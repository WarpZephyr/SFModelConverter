# SFModelConverter
I have changed a lot internally about this project recently.  
I haven't touched it in a while but decided to for some reason.  
The project currently only supports somewhat broken FLVER0 export.  

# Building
If you want to build the project you should clone it with these commands in git bash:  
```
git clone https://github.com/WarpZephyr/SFModelConverter.git  
git clone https://github.com/WarpZephyr/SoulsFormats.git  
```
Then build it in visual studio
